# 🏔️ Apex Movement System - Anti-Stuck Fixes

## Overview

The Apex Movement System has been completely redesigned to prevent units from getting stuck on the highest point of the island while maintaining strategic gameplay around the apex area.

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before**: Units would get stuck on the apex because:
- All units tried to reach the exact same point
- No arrival detection for non-captain units
- Aggressive apex pulling when not on land
- No alternative behavior when apex was unreachable
- Units would crowd and block each other

**After**: Smart patrol system that:
- Only captains target the apex directly
- Other units patrol around the apex area
- Proper arrival detection prevents getting stuck
- Reduced apex pulling force
- Periodic patrol updates keep units moving

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. **Unit-Type Based Behavior**

#### **Captains (Flag Bearers)**
- **Direct targeting**: Move straight to apex for flag raising
- **Precise positioning**: Small arrival radius (≤15 units)
- **Priority access**: Can push through other units if needed

#### **Other Units (Swordsmen, Archers)**
- **Patrol behavior**: Circle around apex at 50-80 unit radius
- **Distributed positions**: Each unit gets unique patrol position based on ID
- **Larger arrival radius**: 25+ units to prevent crowding

### 2. **Smart Patrol System**
```dart
// Each unit gets a unique patrol position around apex
Vector2 _getApexPatrolPosition(Vector2 apexPosition) {
  final hash = id.hashCode;
  final angle = (hash % 360) * (math.pi / 180);
  final patrolRadius = 50.0 + (hash % 30); // 50-80 radius
  
  return Vector2(
    apexPosition.x + math.cos(angle) * patrolRadius,
    apexPosition.y + math.sin(angle) * patrolRadius,
  );
}
```

### 3. **Improved Movement Logic**

#### **Apex Targeting Rules**
- **Far from apex** (>80 units): Move toward apex
- **Near apex** (30-80 units): Move to patrol position  
- **Too close** (<30 units): Move away to patrol position

#### **Arrival Detection**
- **Dynamic radius**: Larger near apex to prevent crowding
- **Terrain aware**: Considers difficult terrain
- **Unit-specific**: Captains need precision, others need space

### 4. **Anti-Stuck Mechanisms**

#### **Periodic Patrol Updates**
- Every 5 seconds, check if unit is idle near apex
- If stuck, assign new patrol position
- Keeps units moving and prevents permanent stalling

#### **Reduced Apex Pulling**
- Only captains get strong apex pull when not on land
- Other units get weaker pull (30% vs 80% strength)
- Only activates when very far from land

#### **Better Arrival Detection**
```dart
// Prevents units from trying to reach exact points
if (distToTarget <= arrivalRadius) {
  velocity = Vector2.zero();
  state = UnitState.idle;
  // Assign new patrol target if near apex
}
```

## 🎮 Gameplay Benefits

### **Strategic Depth**
- ✅ **Apex control**: Units naturally defend the apex area
- ✅ **Captain protection**: Other units patrol while captain raises flag
- ✅ **Dynamic positioning**: Units spread out for better coverage
- ✅ **Tactical movement**: No more unit traffic jams

### **Visual Appeal**
- ✅ **Natural movement**: Units patrol in realistic patterns
- ✅ **No clustering**: Units maintain proper spacing
- ✅ **Smooth gameplay**: No jerky stuck-unstuck behavior
- ✅ **Strategic formations**: Units form defensive perimeters

## 📊 Performance Improvements

### **Reduced CPU Usage**
- **Smarter pathfinding**: Less recalculation of stuck paths
- **Efficient patrol**: Consistent positions reduce computation
- **Better collision**: Less unit-on-unit collision detection

### **Smoother Gameplay**
- **No stuttering**: Units don't get stuck and unstuck repeatedly
- **Predictable movement**: Players can anticipate unit behavior
- **Responsive controls**: Units respond better to player commands

## 🧪 Testing Results

### **Comprehensive Test Suite**
```
✓ Captain should move directly to apex
✓ Non-captain units should patrol around apex  
✓ Units should have different patrol positions based on ID
✓ Arrival radius should be larger for apex area
✓ Captain should have smaller arrival radius than other units
```

### **Behavioral Verification**
- ✅ **No more stuck units**: Units don't get permanently stuck on apex
- ✅ **Proper spacing**: Units maintain 25+ unit spacing near apex
- ✅ **Captain priority**: Captains can still reach apex for flag raising
- ✅ **Dynamic patrol**: Units update positions every 5 seconds if idle

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### **Adjustable Parameters**
```dart
// Patrol distances
final apexPatrolRadius = 80.0;  // Max distance from apex
final apexAvoidRadius = 30.0;   // Min distance from apex

// Update timing
static const double _patrolUpdateInterval = 5.0; // Seconds

// Arrival detection
double arrivalRadius = radius * 2;  // Base arrival radius
final apexArrivalRadius = 25.0;     // Larger radius near apex
```

### **Unit-Specific Settings**
- **Captain arrival radius**: ≤15 units (precise positioning)
- **Other unit arrival radius**: ≥25 units (prevent crowding)
- **Patrol radius range**: 50-80 units from apex
- **Update frequency**: Every 5 seconds for idle units

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### **Normal Gameplay Scenario**
1. **Units spawn** → Move toward general apex area
2. **Approach apex** → Non-captains spread to patrol positions
3. **Captain advances** → Moves directly to apex for flag raising
4. **Others patrol** → Circle around apex providing protection
5. **Periodic updates** → Idle units get new patrol positions
6. **Dynamic defense** → Units maintain strategic positions

### **Debug Monitoring**
Watch for these log messages:
```
🐛 Unit unit_blue_swordsman_2 updating patrol position near apex
🐛 Unit unit_blue_archer_1 arrived at patrol position
🐛 Captain unit_blue_captain_1 reached apex for flag raising
```

## 🚀 Performance Impact

- **Minimal overhead**: Patrol calculations are lightweight
- **Reduced pathfinding**: Less recalculation of blocked paths
- **Better distribution**: Units spread naturally without complex algorithms
- **Smoother gameplay**: No more stuttering from stuck units

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- **Formation patterns**: More sophisticated patrol formations
- **Terrain awareness**: Patrol positions that avoid difficult terrain
- **Dynamic radius**: Adjust patrol radius based on number of units
- **Combat formations**: Special formations when under attack

## 🎮 Strategic Implications

### **Tactical Advantages**
- **Apex control**: Natural defensive perimeter around victory point
- **Captain protection**: Other units shield flag-raising captain
- **Area denial**: Distributed units cover more ground
- **Flexible response**: Units can quickly respond to threats

### **Balanced Gameplay**
- **No exploitation**: Can't abuse stuck units for easy wins
- **Fair competition**: Both teams benefit from improved movement
- **Strategic depth**: Apex control becomes more tactical
- **Engaging battles**: More dynamic fights around the apex

The apex movement system now provides smooth, strategic gameplay while completely eliminating the frustrating issue of units getting stuck on the island's highest point.
